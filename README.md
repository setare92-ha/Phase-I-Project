# Aviation Crash Data Analysis

## 1. Overview

## 2. Business Understanding
### 2.1. Business Objective
This project analyzes the [aviation accident dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) on Kaggle (Note that the actual data we're using is located [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v3/tree/master/data)). The findings will be used to make recommendations to stakeholders that may be looking to expand their business through purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. 

### 2.2. Background Information
Before proceeding any further, we do some research to gain some domain knowledge. Different measures could be considered for assessing the safety of aircrafts. For example, the *number of fatal crashes per every 100,000 flights* seems like a standard measure to consider. The *number of non-fatal incidents that led to injuries* or required the pilot to take extreme measures for landing the aircraft may be considered as a secondary measure [REF](https://assets.performance.gov/APG/files/2023/june/FY2023_June_DOT_Progress_Aviation_Safety.pdf).

Some aspects of safety we can investigate are: 
- aircraft make and model: certain models may be more susciptible to incidents due to inherent manufacturing/design flaws.
- number of engines: a 4-engine aircraft should be safer compared to a 2-engine one
- location: mountanous regions or locations with extreme weather conditions could be more accident-prone.
- manufacturer's safety compliance policies: quantifiable metrics such as the frequency of inspections could be studied provided that the data is available.
