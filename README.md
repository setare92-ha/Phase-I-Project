# Aviation Crash Data Analysis

## 1. Overview
A company is expanding to new industries in an attempt to diversify its portfolio. More specifically, they're interested in purchasing airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. This study focuses on using available aviation crash data to identify aircrafts with the lowest safety risk that the company could invest in for starting their business endevaour in this area. 

## 2. Business Understanding
### 2.1. Business Objective
This project analyzes the [aviation accident dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) on Kaggle (Note that the actual data we're using is located [here](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-1-project-v3/tree/master/data)). The findings will be used to make recommendations to stakeholders that may be looking to expand their business through purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. 

### 2.2. Background Information
Before proceeding any further, we do some research to gain some domain knowledge. Different measures could be considered for assessing the safety of aircrafts. For example, the *number of fatal crashes per every 100,000 flights* seems like a standard measure to consider. The *number of non-fatal incidents that led to injuries* or required the pilot to take extreme measures for landing the aircraft may be considered as a secondary measure [REF](https://assets.performance.gov/APG/files/2023/june/FY2023_June_DOT_Progress_Aviation_Safety.pdf).

Some aspects of safety we can investigate are: 
- **aircraft make and model:** certain models may be more susciptible to incidents due to inherent manufacturing/design flaws.
- **number of engines:** a 4-engine aircraft should be safer compared to a 2-engine one
- **engine type:** Some engine types may be more susciptible to failures than others.  
- **location:** certain regions may have higher number of fatal aviation accidents. Factors like weather, terrain topography and the location being a hub for certain activities may contribute to these statistics.
